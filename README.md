# Basic Budget App

The goal for this application was to build something useful for myself while also using the skills I self-learned over a period of a few weeks to develop a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app.

This includes:
- A template engine (Pug)
- Node.js and npm
- Express.js for directory structure, routing, etc.
- NoSQL MongoDB and Mongoose ORM
